# ToolMart
Welcome to ToolMart!

ToolMart is a market service located on the campus of AAST Al Alamain University. Our goal is to provide tools and resources for engineering, AI, and medical students to help them succeed in their studies and pursue their interests.

We offer a wide range of tools and equipment specifically designed for these fields, including everything from lab equipment to software and hardware. Our online store makes it easy for students to browse and purchase what they need from the comfort of their own homes, and we also have an on-campus location where students can shop in person.

In addition to selling tools and equipment, we also provide resources and support for students. This includes information about the latest technology and innovations in their field, as well as guidance and advice on how to use the tools and equipment.

Our market service is open to all students at AAST Al Alamain, regardless of their major or field of study. We hope to make it as convenient and cost-effective as possible for students to access the tools and resources they need to succeed in their studies and pursue their interests.

We also have a system in place to support the administrative staff on campus, making it easier for them to do their jobs and keep the market running smoothly.

Thank you for choosing Nagymart! We hope to see you on campus or online soon.
